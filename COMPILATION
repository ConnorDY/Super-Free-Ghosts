Compilation
===========

Linux, or Windows with msys:

- `cd Platformer`
- `vim makefile` -- edit STATIC_RESOURCES if need be, rice CFLAGS (-flto!), etc
- `time make -j8` -- or just `make` if you're boring
- It should just work

Windows with MSVC++:

- If you want to build with static resources:
    - CD Platformer
    - ..\tools\make_res.py res
    - Open the project
    - Make sure the "static_resource.c" file is added to the project
    - Make sure STATIC_RESOURCES is defined (no value) for the C preprocessor
    - Build it
    - Edit this readme when you make a profile for it
- If you want to be able to build normally
    - Open the project
    - Build it
